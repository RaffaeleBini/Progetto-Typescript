# Typescript Project: Lifestyle Startup Operations Model
This project involves the development of a system in TypeScript that models the operational structure of a start-up that facilitates citizens' access to state bonuses, focusing on the interactions between start-ups, state incentives and participating citizens.
The project is published on CodePen.

## How it works
The program implements the following features:
- Instantiates some Startup objects to represent innovative enterprises in the field of sport.
- Instantiates Incentive objects to represent the different state incentives available to promote physical activity.
- Creates an instance of the class Citizen for one or more citizens interested in participating in sports initiatives.
- Tests the logic of assigning incentives to startups and the participation of citizens in the promoted activities.

It is possible to access the Program online i CodePen, followig the link below.
